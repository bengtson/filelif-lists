# Lists

Lists is the **FileliF** Lists application. It manages the Lists compendium and provides a web interface to access the lists.

## List Types

Lists can be either event based or named ordered lists.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix FileliF logo and it's position.
- [ ] Write event 'Overdue' evaluation code.
- [ ] Display 'Overdue' events.
- [ ] Fix list entry; better checkbox, wrapped text.
- [ ] Add 'Checked' field into evaluation of events.
- [ ] Add checkbox response to server.
- [ ] Need a way to delete a list item.
- [ ] Evaluate events should be done each time a new date is requested. Evaluation should be saved so that it is not done again. More state for dataserver. Actually, keep a list in each item for all the dates that have been evaluated and the results. Extra storage but no biggie.
- [ ] Add an 'Undo' button to reverse the last action.
